# Getting Started with “Project Purple Cow” app.

Welcome to the "Project Purple Cow" by Eni Olaniyan

In order to start you will need to have docker installed and configured on your device has the react application will run on a docker contaniner.

To Start: please navigate to the base directory of the application and run this command to start the application "docker compose up"

Since the react appliction leaves in the container, that command will thefore install all the dependecies needed for you appication to run the first time which could take a little bit of time. Once all the dependecies are installed, the container should be started on port 3000 as per yml file.

Navigate to localhost:3000 to access the "Project Purple Cow" application
